<h2>College House Canteen Software</h2>

<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>This project is for my university hall of residence's canteen. The canteen was student run each year and would involve stocking food products for students of the hall to buy. In 2019 I was managing the canteen with 2 others and decided to try automate the tedious process which were taking up most of our time. Examples of these are debt tracking, purchase logs and accounting information.</p>
<p>This tool was used with a barcode scanner for students to scan the products they were buying and then log them against their student id. This allowed for easy log recording for sending out bills which for previous years had been written in a book which had to be painfully totaled for each item (which all had different prices) against the purchasers name (out of roughly 170 students). It also allowed for us to monitor debts as we would send bills out every few weeks and to manage the debts of students and keep track of people who had not paid. This software removed a lot of admin tasks increasing our profit margins.</p>

<h3>About:</h3>
<p>This is my first practical use case for software which is why the code is pretty bad, but it was a great learning experience and taught me a lot about the core front end technologies like html css and javascript.</p>
